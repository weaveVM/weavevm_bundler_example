# weavevm_bundler_example

The [WeaveVM Bundler](https://github.com/weavevm/bundler) is an easy way to post data to [WeaveVM](https://wvm.dev) from inside a Rust program. Bundles can contain multiple transactions while incurring only one base fee. Transactions inside bundles are also processed in parallel, meaning they are independent of the networkâ€™s block time.

This example repo demonstrates how to post the full contents of 3 books onchain using WeaveVM Bundler. The books to post are located in the `data` directory.
